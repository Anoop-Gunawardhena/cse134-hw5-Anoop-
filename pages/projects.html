GuideMe was a smart white walking cane developed as a project to aid visually impaired pedestrians to cross a crosswalk
- GuideMe incorporated an Android application that utilized Google Maps API to detect crosswalks, Raspberry Pi 4 complete with a microphone
sensor module to detect cars, and a text-to-speech interface to communicate with the user.
- Served as a lead Pi developer and implemented a strategy to localize sound recorded by microphone and developed the consensus algorithm
that was responsible for determining if a sound was indicative of a threat when crossing.</pre>
