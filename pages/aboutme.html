    <p> I’m currently
        an incoming fourth-year student at the University of California at San Diego majoring in Computer
        Engineering at the Jacobs School of Engineering. In the last three years, I have completed a respectable
        amount of coursework on various programming languages, computer systems, data structures, data
        organization, digital design, computer architecture, algorithms, and even software development. During
        this time I have worked on multiple projects, the most notable being a web application that simulated the
        functionality of a bullet journal and a movie recommender that incorporated machine learning. One of my
        other stronger interests is relational databases, aside from being supplemented by coursework has been
        strengthened by continuous use in many projects, I’m most familiar with SQL and keep myself well in
        practice.</p>
        <h3>My interests and Hobbies</h3>
        <details>
            <summary>Mixed Martial Arts</summary>
            <p>Growing up the youngest is tough enough, but throw in the fact that I was stubbornly insistent on growing taller than my elder brother, and you get a lot of fights.
                Fortunately this turned out positve as my brother and I both came to love combat sports and mixed martial arts in specific.
